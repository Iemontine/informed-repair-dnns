  abstract  = {Vision Transformers have emerged as state-of-the-art image
               recognition tools, but may still exhibit incorrect behavior.
               Incorrect image recognition can have disastrous consequences in
               safety-critical real-world applications such as self-driving
               automobiles. In this paper, we present Provable Repair of Vision
               Transformers ({PRoViT}), a provable repair approach that guarantees
               the correct classification of images in a repair set for a given
               Vision Transformer without modifying its architecture. {PRoViT}
               avoids negatively affecting correctly classified images (drawdown)
               by minimizing the changes made to the Vision Transformer’s
               parameters and original output. We observe that for Vision
               Transformers, unlike for other architectures such as {ResNet} or {
               VGG}, editing just the parameters in the last layer achieves
               correctness guarantees and very low drawdown. We introduce a novel
               method for editing these last-layer parameters that enables {PRoViT
               } to efficiently repair state-of-the-art Vision Transformers for
               thousands of images, far exceeding the capabilities of prior
               provable repair approaches.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks ({DNNs}) are becoming increasingly important
              components of software, and are considered the state-of-the-art
              solution for a number of problems, such as image recognition.
              However, {DNNs} are far from infallible, and incorrect behavior of
              {DNNs} can have disastrous real-world consequences. This paper
              addresses the problem of architecture-preserving V-polytope
              provable repair of {DNNs}. A V-polytope defines a convex bounded
              polytope using its vertex representation. V-polytope provable
              repair guarantees that the repaired {DNN} satisfies the given
              specification on the infinite set of points in the given
              V-polytope. An architecture-preserving repair only modifies the
              parameters of the {DNN}, without modifying its architecture. The
              repair has the flexibility to modify multiple layers of the {DNN},
              and runs in polynomial time. It supports {DNNs} with activation
              functions that have some linear pieces, as well as fully-connected,
              convolutional, pooling and residual layers. To the best our
              knowledge, this is the first provable repair approach that has all
              of these features. We implement our approach in a tool called {
              APRNN}. Using {MNIST}, {ImageNet}, and {ACAS} Xu {DNNs}, we show
              that it has better efficiency, scalability, and generalization
              compared to {PRDNN} and {REASSURE}, prior provable repair methods
              that are not architecture preserving.},

  abstract  = {Deep Neural Networks ({DNNs}) have grown in popularity over the
               past decade and are now being used in safety-critical domains such
               as aircraft collision avoidance. This has motivated a large number
               of techniques for finding unsafe behavior in {DNNs}. In contrast,
               this paper tackles the problem of correcting a {DNN} once unsafe
               behavior is found. We introduce the provable repair problem, which
               is the problem of repairing a network N to construct a new network
               N′ that satisfies a given specification. If the safety
               specification is over a finite set of points, our Provable Point
               Repair algorithm can find a provably minimal repair satisfying the
               specification, regardless of the activation functions used. For
               safety specifications addressing convex polytopes containing
               infinitely many points, our Provable Polytope Repair algorithm can
               find a provably minimal repair satisfying the specification for {
               DNNs} using piecewise-linear activation functions. The key insight
               behind both of these algorithms is the introduction of a Decoupled
               {DNN} architecture, which allows us to reduce provable repair to a
               linear programming problem. Our experimental results demonstrate
               the efficiency and effectiveness of our Provable Repair algorithms
               on a variety of challenging tasks.},
